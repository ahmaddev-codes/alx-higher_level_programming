# ALX SE - Higher Level Programming with Python
![Python](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png)
## Description
This repository contains projects on Python programming language.
* Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
* Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
* Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
* Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
* Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.
* Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting.
* Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
* Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.
